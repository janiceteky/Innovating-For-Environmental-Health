		<p>Understanding the importance of good indoor air quality (IAQ) in schools is the backbone of developing an effective IAQ program. Poor IAQ can lead to a large variety of health problems and potentially affect comfort, concentration and staff/student performance.  Since most people spend 90 percent of their time indoors, children especially are at risk of exposure to indoor air pollutants, they breathe in more air than adults.

		In addition, schools have reported experiencing poor ventilation which is a precursor to increased buildup of other indoor air pollutants.
